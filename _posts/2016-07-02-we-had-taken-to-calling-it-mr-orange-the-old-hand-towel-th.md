We had taken to calling it Mr. Orange: the old hand towel the color of the 70s that was somewhat threadbare even before I started to use it for grooming the cats almost twenty years ago.

Over the years, whenever I'd lay out the towel Chaysei would trot over and plop herself down and consent to be groomed and fussed over for a few minutes, until she decided it was time for teeth and claws and biting and she'd attack the Sheddin' Blade. Usually.

Sometimes she'd go for my hand instead.

That was many years ago; the towel is even more faded and ragged now, but Chay is still the same flaming orange. But over the past weeks her kidneys worsened to the point of complete failure. In spite of diet changes and phosphorous binders and twice daily IV fluids, she'd gotten too weak to walk two weeks ago. Finally today she could no longer even drink.

So it was time. Even if her body was failing her, her heart was still so strong and her attitude as grumpy as always -- she still tried to take a swipe at the vet, even though she'd been too weak to move all day.

She went out snuggling Mr. Orange, working her little white mittened paws. I hope she was dreaming of groomings past; I hope in her dreams she catches me.

Goodnight Chaysei. Sleep well.
